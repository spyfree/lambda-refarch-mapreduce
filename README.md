# Serverless Reference Architecture: MapReduce

This serverless MapReduce reference architecture demonstrates how to use [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda) in conjunction with [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3) to build a MapReduce framework that can process data stored in S3. 

By leveraging this framework, you can build a cost-effective pipeline to run ad hoc MapReduce jobs. The price-per-query model and ease of use make it very suitable for data scientists and developers alike.
